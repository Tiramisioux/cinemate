# CineMate â€“ manual controls for cinepi-raw
CineMate scripts is a way for users to implement and customize manual controls for their [cinepi-raw](https://github.com/cinepi/cinepi-raw) build. 

Project aims at offering an easy way to build a custom camera. For basic operation and experimentation, only Raspberry Pi, camera board and monitor is needed. For practical use, buttons and switches can easily be added, allowing for a custom build.

A ready made disk image, with a Bullseye installation + cinepi-raw and CineMate scripts can be found in the release section of this repo.

## Hardware requirements
- Rasberry Pi 4B
- Official HQ or GS camera
- External HDMI monitor
- Samsung T5/T7 SSD or Samsung Extreme SSD 

## Installing 

Download the disk image from here: https://github.com/Tiramisioux/cinemate/releases/tag/dev

Burn to SD card (> 8 GB) using Raspberry Pi imager or Balena Etcher. 

| :exclamation:  When connecting the camera module to the Pi, make sure it is the Pi is not powered. It is not advised to hot-swap the camera cable.   |
|-----------------------------------------|

## Basic build

Use simple buttons to the Pi for basic camera operation.

|Camera function                 |GPIO push button |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
|start/stop recording            |5                |
|increase iso one step           |27               |
|decrease iso one step           |15               |
|change resolution               |26 (single click)|
|reboot                          |26 (double click)|
|safe shutdown                   |26 (triple click)|
|unmount SSD                     |26 (hold for 3 seconds)|

Rec light LED can be connected to pins 6 and 21. 

| :exclamation:  When connecting an LED to the GPIOs, be sure to use a resistor   |
|-----------------------------------------|


||Default legal values (arrays)                      |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|iso           |100, 200, 400, 640, 800, 1200, 1600, 2500 and 3200.|
|shutter angle |1-360 in one degree increments + 172.8 and 346.6   |
|fps           |1-50 fps @ 2028x1080, 1-40 fps @ 2028x1520         |


|:point_up:  Connect GPIO 26 to GPIO 03 using a jumper wire, and the system button attached to GPIO 26 will also wake up the Pi, after being shutdown.   |
|-----------------------------------------|

## Adding rotary encoders

For controlling iso, shutter angle and frame rate rotary encoders can be used. To engage parameter lock, click the rotary encoder push button.

|                                 |clk |dt  |encoder button|
|---------------------------------|----|----|--------------|
|set iso                          |9   |11  |10            |
|set shutter angle                |23  |25  |13            |
|set fps                          |7   |8   |20            |

The button also allows for combined actions together with the system button (GPIO 26).


## Simple GUI

to be added

## Connecting via SSH

For SSH:ing to the Pi, use the following credentials:

    User: pi
    Password: 1

## CineMate CLI

Cinemate offers a set of Command-Line Interface (CLI) commands that allow users to control camera settings directly from the terminal. This guide will walk you through how to use these commands effectively, including the optional use of arguments to toggle controls.

#### Disabling CineMate autostart

CineMate autostarts by default. To disable autostart:

    cd cinemate
    make stop

To enable (and start) again

    cd cinemate
    make start

To run CineMate manually, anywhere in the cli, type

    cinemate


## Trying out camera functions

To start CineMate manually, type `cinemate` anywhere in the cli. This will show a startup sequence and the terminal will now accept the commands from the list below.

![CineMate startup sequence](docs/images/cinemate_cli.png)

*Example startup sequence, showing the output from CineMates modules*


For extensive logging and troubleshooting, start CineMate using the `cinemate -debug` command.

## Example CLI commands

**Start/stop recording:**

    > rec

**Set ISO:** Adjust the ISO setting. Requires an integer argument.

    > set_iso 800

**Set Shutter Angle:** Set the shutter angle. Requires a float argument for the angle.

    > set_shutter_a 172.8

**Set FPS:** Configure the frames per second. Requires an integer argument.

    > set_fps 24


**Lock/unlock iso, shutter angle , fps:** Toggle locks or set them directly. Providing an argument directly sets the value. Omitting the argument will toggle the control.

    > set_iso_lock

    > set_shutter_a_nom_lock 1

    > set_fps_lock

**Double FPS (set_fps_double):** Enable or disable doubling the FPS rate.

    > set_fps_double
    
    > set_fps_double 1

This table includes all the available commands (method calls) for the CineMate CLI and the GPIO default settings of `cinemate/src/settings.json`. 

Commands are also possible to send to the Pi via USB serial.

## Customizing camera functions and GPIO settings


The settings file can be found in `cinemate/src/settings.json`. Here the user can define their own buttons, switches, rotary encoders and combined actions, modifying the table above.

| :exclamation:  Note that if you update this repo, your setting-file will be overwritten with the latest default CineMate settings file. If you are using a custom settings file, be sure to copy it to somewhere outside of the cinemate folder before updating.   |
|-----------------------------------------|




### General Settings
Define your hardware setup and desired application behavior:

    {
    "pwm_pin": 19,
    "rec_out_pin": [6, 21],
    "iso_steps": [100, 200, 400, 640, 800, 1200, 1600, 2500, 3200],
    "additional_shutter_a_steps": [172.8, 346.6],
    "fps_steps": null
    }

### Analog Controls
Map physical controls to their functions in the application:

    "analog_controls": {
    "iso_pot": "A0",
    "shutter_a_pot": "A2",
    "fps_pot": "A4"
    }

### Buttons

Setup buttons with actions for different interactions:

    "buttons": [
    {
        "pin": 5,
        "pull_up": "False",
        "debounce_time": "0.1",
        "press_action": {"method": "rec"}
    }
    ]

Each button can be configured with a variety of actions based on different interactions:

**Press Action:** Triggers a specified method upon a simple press.

**Single, Double, and Triple Click Actions:** Specify methods to execute based on the number of successive clicks.

**Hold Action:** Executes a method when the button is held down for a longer duration.

Each action can specify a method that corresponds to a function within the application, and args, an array of arguments that the method requires.

Note that if you have both a Press Action and a Single-Click action on a pin, the pin will first execute the Press Action and when released, execute the Single-Click Action. Combining Press Action and Click actions on the same pin is therefore not recommended.

### Two-way switches
Two-way switches are configured in the two_way_switches section and have actions for both states:

**State On Action** and **State Off Action**: Define what actions to take when the switch is turned on or off, respectively. Similar to button actions, these can specify a method and args.

    "two_way_switches": [
    {
        "pin": 16,
        "state_on_action": {"method": "set_shutter_a_sync", "args": [false]},
        "state_off_action": {"method": "set_shutter_a_sync", "args": [true]}
      },
    }
    ]

### Rotary Encoders
Configure rotary encoders for settings adjustments and optional button presses:

    "rotary_encoders": [
      {
        "clk_pin": 9,
        "dt_pin": 11,
        "button_pin": 10,
        "pull_up": "False",
        "debounce_time": "0.05",
        "button_actions": {
          "press_action": "None",
          "single_click_action": {"method": "set_iso_lock"},
          "double_click_action": "None",
          "hold_action": "None"
        },
        "encoder_actions": {
          "rotate_clockwise": {"method": "inc_iso", "args": []},
          "rotate_counterclockwise": {"method": "dec_iso", "args": []}
        }
    }
    ]

**Clockwise and Counterclockwise Actions**: Specify methods to execute when the encoder is rotated in either direction.

**Button Actions:** If the encoder has a push button, configure actions similar to standalone buttons, including press, click, and hold interactions.

### Combined Actions
Set up interactions involving multiple inputs:

    "combined_actions": [
    {
      "hold_button_pin": 13,
      "action_button_pin": 26,
      "action_type": "press",
      "action": {"method": "set_shutter_a_sync"}
    }

Combined actions allow for complex interactions involving multiple buttons or switches:

**Hold Button Pin** and **Action Button Pin:** Define the pins of the buttons involved in the combined action.

**Action Type:** Specifies the type of action required from the action_button_pin (e.g., press). 

**Action:** Determines the method to execute when the combined action condition is met.
