# Notes on Audio Sync

The actual frame rate of the IMX477 sensor fluctuates about 0.01% around the mean value. This has no visual impact but will affect the syncing of external audio. If recording synced audio, make sure to use a clapperboard at the beginning and the end of the take. This will make it easier to sync the sound, but sync might still drift back and forth.
