#### Application in CineMate

In the CineMate context, the Grove Base HAT is utilized to connect potentiometers that control various camera settings such as ISO, shutter angle, and frame rate. The `AnalogControls` class in the `gpio_input.py` module handles this integration, allowing for smooth and precise adjustments using analog inputs.

#### Integration in CineMate

The `AnalogControls` class is responsible for reading analog values from the Grove Base HAT and mapping them to specific camera settings.

**Initialization and Configuration:**
- **I2C Setup**: Initializes the I2C bus and checks if the Grove Base HAT is connected.
- **Potentiometer Mapping**: Maps analog inputs from the Grove Base HAT to specific camera settings using ADC channels.

**Runtime Operation:**
- **Reading Analog Values**: Continuously reads values from the potentiometers connected to the Grove Base HAT.
- **Calculating Settings**: Converts the analog readings into specific camera settings (ISO, shutter angle, FPS) using predefined steps.
- **Updating Camera Settings**: Applies the calculated settings to the camera in real-time.

**Example Usage:**

1. **Initialization**:
   The `AnalogControls` class is initialized with references to the `cinepi_controller` and the ADC channels for ISO, shutter angle, and FPS potentiometers.

   ```python
   self.analog_controls = AnalogControls(
       self.cinepi_controller,
       iso_pot=0,  # ADC channel for ISO potentiometer
       shutter_a_pot=2,  # ADC channel for shutter angle potentiometer
       fps_pot=4  # ADC channel for FPS potentiometer
   )
   ```

2. **Setting Calculations**:
   The `calculate_iso`, `calculate_shutter_a`, and `calculate_fps` methods convert the analog readings into corresponding camera settings.

   ```python
   def calculate_iso(self, value):
       self.iso_readings.append(value)
       if self.iso_readings:
           average_value = sum(self.iso_readings) / len(self.iso_readings)
           index = round((len(self.iso_steps) - 1) * average_value / 1000)
           try:
               return self.iso_steps[index]
           except IndexError:
               logging.error("Error occurred while accessing ISO list elements.")
               return None
       else:
           logging.warning("No ISO readings available.")
           return None
   ```

3. **Parameter Updates**:
   The `update_parameters` method reads values from the ADC and updates the camera settings accordingly.

   ```python
   def update_parameters(self):
       if self.iso_pot is not None:
           iso_read = self.adc.read(self.iso_pot)
           iso_new = self.calculate_iso(iso_read)
           if iso_new != self.last_iso:
               self.cinepi_controller.set_iso(iso_new)
               self.last_iso = iso_new

       if self.shutter_a_pot is not None:
           shutter_a_read = self.adc.read(self.shutter_a_pot)
           shutter_a_new = self.calculate_shutter_a(shutter_a_read)
           if shutter_a_new != self.last_shutter_a:
               self.cinepi_controller.set_shutter_a_nom(shutter_a_new)
               self.last_shutter_a = shutter_a_new

       if self.fps_pot is not None:
           fps_read = self.adc.read(self.fps_pot)
           fps_new = self.calculate_fps(fps_read)
           if fps_new != self.last_fps:
               self.cinepi_controller.set_fps(int(fps_new))
               self.last_fps = fps_new
   ```

### Configuration in `settings.json`

To configure the Grove Base HAT for use in CineMate, update the `settings.json` file with the ADC channels for the potentiometers controlling ISO, shutter angle, and FPS.

Hereâ€™s an example configuration:

```json
{
  "analog_controls": {
    "iso_pot": 0,         // ADC channel for ISO potentiometer
    "shutter_a_pot": 2,   // ADC channel for shutter angle potentiometer
    "fps_pot": 4          // ADC channel for FPS potentiometer
  },
  "iso_steps": [100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200],
  "shutter_a_steps": [45, 90, 180, 360],
  "fps_steps": [24, 25, 30, 60]
}
```

### Applying Changes

Once you have updated the `settings.json` file with your desired configuration, restart the CineMate application to apply the changes. The analog controls will now be mapped to the specified camera settings, allowing for smooth and precise adjustments using the Grove Base HAT.

### Conclusion

The Grove Base HAT for Raspberry Pi significantly enhances the usability and flexibility of the CineMate system by providing analog control inputs for key camera settings. By configuring the potentiometers in the `settings.json` file, users can achieve precise and real-time control over ISO, shutter angle, and frame rate, making the CineMate setup more versatile and user-friendly.
