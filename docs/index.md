# Cinemate Docs

Welcome to the **Cinemate** project - an open-source boiler plate for building your own digital cinema camera using a Raspberry Pi 5. It combines a lightweight Python interface with the [CinePi‑raw recorder by Csaba Nagy](https://github.com/cinepi) for capturing 12‑bit CinemaDNG footage.

To begin, follow the steps in [Quick start](getting-started.md). Later chapters explain how to customise the system to tailor Cinemate to your needs.

For sharing your build with others, inspiration and discussion, make sure to join the [CinePi Discord](https://discord.gg/Hr4dfhuK).
