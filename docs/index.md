# Cinemate Docs

Welcome to the **Cinemate** project - an open-source boiler plate for building your own digital cinema camera using a Raspberry Pi 5. It combines a lightweight Python interface with the [CinePi‑raw recorder by Csaba Nagy](https://github.com/cinepi) for capturing 12‑bit CinemaDNG footage.

This guide is written for newcomers with little Linux or Raspberry Pi experience. The **Quick start** section walks you through flashing the SD card, connecting the camera module and making your first recording. Later chapters explain how to customise the system, manage services and dive deeper into the software.

To begin, follow the steps in [Quick start](getting-started.md). Once you’re comfortable recording footage, explore the other topics in the sidebar to tailor Cinemate to your needs.
