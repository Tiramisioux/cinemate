# Overview

CineMate scripts offer users the ability to implement and customize manual controls for their [cinepi-raw](https://github.com/cinepi/cinepi-raw) build.

CineMate acts as an extension and enhancement to the core CinePi raw functionalities, adding a higher level of user customization, control, and additional features. 

For basic operation and experimentation, only a Raspberry Pi, camera board, and a device for monitoriing, such as a phone or tablet are needed.. For practical use, buttons and switches can easily be added, allowing for a custom build.

A ready-made disk image, with a Raspbian installation + cinepi-raw and CineMate scripts can be found here.
