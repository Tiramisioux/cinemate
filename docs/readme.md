# What is it?
**Cinemate** is a boilerplate cinema camera system for Raspberry Pi 5 building on [CinePiâ€‘RAW recorder by Csaba Nagy](https://github.com/cinepi) for enabling 12 bit (or even 16 bit) Cinema DNG recordings using off-the-shelf components.  

Cinemate provides a minimal starting point that you can extend with your own controls and accessories. 

The project combines a Python UI with a custom fork of [cinepi-raw](https://github.com/Tiramisioux/cinepi-raw/tree/rpicam-apps_1.7_custom_encoder).
