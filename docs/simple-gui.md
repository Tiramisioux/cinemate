# Simple GUI

Simple GUI is available via browser and/or attached HDMI monitor.

- Red color means camera is recording.
- Purple color means camera detected a drop frame 
- Green color means camera is writing buffered frames to disk. You can still start recording at this stage, but any buffered frames from the last recording will be lost.

Buffer meter in the lower left indicates number of frames in buffer. Useful when testing storage media.

When a compatible USB microphone is connected, VU meters appear on the right side of the GUI so you can monitor audio levels.
